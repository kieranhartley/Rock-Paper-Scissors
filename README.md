# Rock-Paper-Scissors
Rock Paper Scissors web app created to practise my Javascript skills 

This project was an excellent learning experience, I learned some basic HTML/CSS layout and plenty of different uses of Javascript variables and functions. I also touched on DOM manipulation and learned the importance of caching DOM elements. It was fun to analyse and apply the rules of the Rock Paper Scissor game in the code and test it to ensure it works.

On this project I learned:
- How to turn the games rules into logical functions in Javascript
- DOM manipulation
- Caching DOM
- Basic HTML layout
- Basic CSS
- Button with hover effect
